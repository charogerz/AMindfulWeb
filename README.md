# A Mindful Web

A thesis project being ever iterated on by Charlotte Rogers | Parsons School of Design, MFA Design and Technology 2024

*A Mindful Web* supports web designers through the trauma-informed design process. It provides resources to reference in consideration of an audience that has experienced certain forms of trauma. It is a website designed and built to house a series of videos with examples of trauma-informed web features, a basic explanation of the framework, and a list of external resources for further reading or to see other designers' related open-source code. I hope in the future to expand on what I have started here to include more focused resources helpful to those who have experienced different types of trauma and hold different intersectional identities because all of this will affect the way designers should approach their work.
